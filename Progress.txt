Roadmap

1. Create Map
2. X and Os
3. Player
4. Graphic
5. MVC 



1. Create Map
    * An 2D matrix of X and Os and something that represents empty spots
    * Set X and Os, if empty
    * Check if there are 3 lines of either X or Os
        * Horizontal 3 cases
        * Vertical 3 cases
        * Diagonal 2 cases
        
            [0][0] [0][1] [0][2]
            [1][0] [1][1] [1][2]
            [2][0] [2][1] [2][2]

            [
                [X,X,X]
                [X,X,X]
                [X,X,X]
            ]

2. X and Os 
    * X and Y value

3. Player
    * Has either X or O as attribute
    * Turn
    * Name
    * 

4. Graphic
    * 

5. MVC



RETHINK

X and O should include how they are drawn

Play area for each square create intervalls, so a Piece is drawn on the center

MODEL - manipulates data

Controller calls model methods

View calls Controller when an action occurs

GameLoop
    Set current Player
    While it is still current_players turn and No winners
        repaint()
        end GameLoop

Change methods
    view 
        MouseEvent
            When pressed get X and Y
            Should paint a Piece (X or O) on that area

Player
    Connect a piece and a player, should the attribue be of type piece or string
    String, if the game will only consist of X and O
    Type Piece for further extension

    if type Piece
    How to create a empty Piece with null coordinates and use exceptionhandling to ignore it

REDO MVC and graphics

WRITE TESTS FOR THE MODEL (i.e playarea, spots, player, pieces)




Check winner algortim(){
    String winner;
    Check_horizontal(winner);
    Check_vertical(winner);
    Check_diagonal(winner);
    return winner
}



[[x,x,x],
[x,x,x],
[x,x,x]]
